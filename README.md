# fizz-buzz-challenge

I've made this repository so I can make this little challenge in every language I know/learn. It was inspired by one of the projects of this repository https://github.com/karan/Projects#data-structures btw. So, basically, what I have to do here is print fuzz for multiples of 3 and buzz for multiples of 5 and, when it's not into this condition, I just print the number.
